Working PSD files should live here. When a new branch for this repository is created, you will find template
PSDs in here, you can simply rename this file to `theme-1.psd` or `theme-2.psd` etc depending on how many
theme variations you need to create. You may have multiple PSD files for project that have quite different
look and feel across various pages - that's fine too, just create a PSD file for each major feature as you need.

Your PSDs in this folder, and assets in sub-folders *do not* need to have copies made as you save, Git will
version the files automatically when you save and then describe your change & `sync` in the Github desktop app.
